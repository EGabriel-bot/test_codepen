        <p class="opening">
          Setting goals can be an effective way to help yourself grow and
          develop, both personally and within your career and relationships.
          When you set goals for yourself, you are ultimately approaching
          success with an open mind, and making progress toward your goals can
          allow you to improve your skills and knowledge and even learn new
          skills. Consider setting short-term goals to start with, and you may
          use these goals to help you achieve larger, long-term goals. In this
          article, we list a variety of examples of personal goals you could set
          for yourself as a starting point when determining the milestones you
          want to meet in your life.
        </p>

        <h2>What are personal goals?</h2>
        <p class="personal">
          Personal goals are short- or long-term goals that can apply to your
          work, family-life or lifestyle. They are meant to motivate you to
          achieve what you want in life.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Be more proactive.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          Once you set a goal for yourself, you can choose to take action each
          day to further your progress toward achievement. If you choose to
          remain inactive, there can be a chance that you might not achieve your
          goals. Motivating yourself to be more proactive in your endeavors can
          serve as a personal goal to help you get used to setting a goal,
          taking action, tracking your progress and achieving objectives.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Learn to understand myself.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          Learning to understand yourself can allow you to accept your
          abilities, improve your skills and ultimately play a role in how you
          pace yourself when working toward your objectives. Understanding and
          knowing what your boundaries are, what your strengths are and how you
          adapt to change can not only help you progress toward your success, it
          can help build confidence in yourself.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Learn how to make efective decisions.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          Big decisions in life—from buying a new car to planning your
          retirement—can offer growth opportunities. However, it's not always
          easy to make huge choices like these. When you learn and apply
          effective decision-making strategies, such as evaluating all your
          options for a retirement fund, you can better equip yourself to handle
          the important choices in your life.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Learn from failure.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          Failure is sometimes part of the process of moving toward achieving
          your goals. However, failure does not have to determine your overall
          success. Consider failure an opportunity to learn how to approach
          things differently, try new methods or learn new strategies. Learning
          from failure can aid in your achievements by showing you different and
          more effective ways of doing things.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Start good habits.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          It can take a lot of effort to create and maintain good habits, but
          forming positive habits can influence your personal development and
          help in improving your overall quality of life. Consider forming one
          good habit over the course of 30 days, such as taking a 10-minute walk
          every evening, and you might see the change and improvement in your
          well-being and motivation to keep achieving more.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Live according to your values.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          Your morals and values can influence how you progress through your
          career, relationships and life in general. However, if you ignore your
          values in favor of someone else's, you may never achieve your goals.
          Consider staying consistent in your morals, and work toward your goals
          with your personal values in mind.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Learn to accept your limits.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          Understanding your limits and learning from your mistakes ultimately
          helps you progress toward your goals. While it may seem as if making
          mistakes or finding limitations in your personal progress may be
          negative, in reality, it can actually have a positive influence in
          teaching you how to handle setbacks and find solutions to problems.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Eliminate bad habits.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          Similar to starting good habits, eliminating or making an effort to
          stop a bad habit can positively influence your growth and progress
          toward other goals you may set for yourself. Consider taking one to
          two months to identify and cease a bad habit, such as biting your
          nails or eating high-sugar foods just before bed.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Try to always learn something new.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          You might make a goal to learn a new skill, topic or take a class to
          learn how to paint. Whatever you choose to learn, committing to
          continue gaining knowledge and expertise can help you develop and
          advance in life.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Improve time management skills.</h3>
        <p class="definition">
          If you have ever felt that you frequently run out of time to complete
          tasks or have limited time to devote to activities you enjoy outside
          of work, consider applying strategies that can help you improve your
          time management skills. Print a physical schedule or to-do list you
          can mark with a pen as you complete tasks. Similarly, you might set a
          timer to help you track the time you spend on specific activities to
          evaluate where you can cut back on time spent and add time to other
          activities you need to complete.
